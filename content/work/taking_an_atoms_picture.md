# How is a picture taken?

You’re lining up your phone to take a picture of your dog.
Light comes down from the sun,
bounces off the dog,
and into your camera lens,
allowing you to take the photo.
Your eyes work similarly,
taking in all the light particles—known
as photons—that
are scattering off of objects in the world.
Most things see by detecting these bouncing photons,
which is why both you and your phone have a hard time
seeing anything at all
when the lights are off.

      A photon comes down from the sun,
      bounces off the dog,
      and enters your phone through the camera lens.
      This is how your phone takes a picture and how your eyes see.

# Electrons are the new photons

If two objects are brought close enough to each other
under the right conditions,
electrons from one object are transferred to the other.
What’s useful is that these electrons
don’t suffer the same problem the photons do.
Even if two objects are incredibly close—such
as two neighboring atoms—it
is possible to detect which electron came from which atom.

So instead of seeing with photons—like
a normal camera—atoms
are seen with electrons.
Since the particle being used is different,
the “camera“ will need to be different as well.
Traditional cameras have a lens that lets the photons through.
Electrons travel differently than photons—so
instead of a lens,
a sharp wire is used to pull electrons through
to equipment that can detect them.
If the wire is sharp enough at its tip,
it will be able to tell which atom the electron comes from.

      receive electrons from atoms
      when the two are brought close to each other.

By moving this sharpened wire tip across a flat surface,
electrons may be received from all of the objects present.
This wire can image the shapes of atoms due to a special relation
between how far an object is from the wire
and how many electrons it will give up.
Objects further away from the wire give only a few electrons,
while objects really close to the wire will give it many electrons.
The software connected to the wire
will draw a picture based on the electrons it receives—coloring
in bright spots where it counts a lot of electrons,
and dark areas where it counts only a few electrons.
This is how these atoms are detected,
and how their picture is taken.
With a camera,
objects are seen by detecting the photons that bounced off of them.
Atoms,
however,
are seen by detecting their electrons.
So when the wire produces a photo,
it is actually visualizing the electrons
that the objects hold inside themselves.
Using sharp wires to take pictures by detecting electrons from surfaces
is a technique known as Scanning Tunneling Microscopy—or
STM for short.

      An STM tip takes an image of an atom.
      When an object is close to the tip
      it receives a lot of electrons.
      When it is far
      it receives fewer.
      Using this basic idea,
      the tip can image atoms—as
      seen on the right.

# More than just a camera

The way that STM captures an image
is pretty different from how a normal camera would.
The unique way STM produces pictures
not only enable it to image really small objects,
but also allow it to do things normal cameras can’t.
STM is not just for taking pictures.

If the STM tip is moved very close to an atom,
interactions between the two
will cause the atom to be attracted to the tip.
The tip may then pick up the atom
and drop it back off at another location.
Using STM,
scientists can manipulate individual atoms—controlling
where they lie on a surface.
Structures can be built,
words can be spelled out,
and even movies can be made by using atoms to draw characters.

STM is a powerful tool
used to observe the smallest fundamental building blocks of our world.
As technology trends towards smaller and smaller devices
STM remains an important tool.
Using it researchers can observe how materials are structured at an atomic level
and build their own atomic sized devices.
