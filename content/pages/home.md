# Hey, I'm Paulo S. Costa

I do software engineering work
mostly centered around machine learning ranking systems
and their tooling.
I've worked at Faire's and Instagram's recommendations machine learning team,
at Meta's core machine learning team for ads,
and at Meta's machine learning infra team.
I also do some hobby open source work around Python and cli tooling and documentation.
